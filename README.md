# mTab Spring Boot

This project provides a minimal Spring Boot configuration using the latest release. 

The entrypoint is `com.mtab.spring.boot.Application` and the server will be start on port 8080.

## Tasks
1. Add an API that accepts some structured data of your choosing
2. This API should persist the data using any method, it does not need to be durable
3. Add a second API that can retrieve the data persisted by the first API
4. If you have time, add tests that ensure the correctness of your implementation

## Notes
- You may add any third party libraries but be prepared to justify your choice
- Use modern Java language features where appropriate
- Use Spring Framework features where appropriate
